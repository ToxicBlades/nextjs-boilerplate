# Renovate

Renovate is an open-source tool designed to automate the updating of dependencies in projects, such as npm packages, Docker images, or other dependencies defined in files. It utilizes a `renovate.json` configuration file to define rules and settings for automating dependency updates, such as scheduling, grouping, and version constraints.

To integrate Renovate into your application, you also need to add it from the GitHub Extensions Marketplace.

## Thoughts on Renovate

I personally think Renovate is both a good and a bad tool. If you don’t plan to actively maintain your project, Renovate can end up creating a flood of pull requests and commits, which might actually break your build.

To make the most out of Renovate, I highly recommend using a well-defined configuration (like the one I’ve provided). This ensures most of the changes will either be small patches or grouped PRs with updates, making them manageable and reducing potential risks.
